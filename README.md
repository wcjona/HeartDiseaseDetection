### VIII. Appendix

The project was implemented in **Python 3.12** using **Jupyter Notebooks**. The codebase is divided into three notebooks, each thoroughly documented for reproducibility:

- `data_cleaning.ipynb`
- `data_analysis.ipynb`
- `data_training.ipynb`

#### To Run the Code:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/wcjona/HeartDiseaseDetection.git
   ```

2. **Install the required libraries**:
   ```bash
   pip3 install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```

3. **Execute the notebooks in the following order**:
   - `data_cleaning.ipynb`
   - `data_analysis.ipynb`
   - `data_training.ipynb`
